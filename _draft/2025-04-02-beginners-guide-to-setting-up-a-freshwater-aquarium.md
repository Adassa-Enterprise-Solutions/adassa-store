## Step 1: Choose the Right Aquarium Size
A 10-gallon tank is a great starting point, but larger tanks (20-30 gallons) provide more stability and are easier to maintain. Consider the space you have available and the type of fish you want to keep.

## Step 2: Gather Essential Equipment
You will need the following:

- **Aquarium Tank** – Choose glass or acrylic.
- **Filtration System** – Maintains water quality.
- **Heater** – Essential for tropical fish.
- **Substrate** – Gravel, sand, or plant-friendly substrate.
- **Lighting** – LED lights enhance fish colors and support plant growth.
- **Water Conditioner** – Removes harmful chemicals from tap water.
- **Test Kit** – Measures pH, ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates.

## Step 3: Set Up Your Aquarium
1. Rinse the tank and equipment (avoid soap!).
2. Add the substrate and decorations.
3. Install the filter and heater.
4. Fill the tank with dechlorinated water.
5. Turn on the filter and heater, then let the tank cycle for at least a week before adding fish.

## Step 4: Choose the Right Fish
For beginners, consider hardy species like:

- Betta Fish
- Guppies
- Tetras
- Platies
- Corydoras Catfish

## Step 5: Maintain Water Quality
- Perform 20% water changes weekly.
- Use a test kit to monitor water parameters.
- Avoid overfeeding to prevent water contamination.
