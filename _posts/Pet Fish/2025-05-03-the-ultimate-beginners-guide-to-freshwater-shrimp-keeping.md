## Why Keep Freshwater Shrimp?

Freshwater shrimp like Cherry Shrimp and Amano Shrimp are peaceful, beautiful, and 
surprisingly low-maintenance. They're perfect for small tanks, and their algae-eating 
habits help keep your aquarium clean. Best of all, watching them graze and explore is 
both relaxing and fascinating.

## Best Shrimp for Beginners

Here are some beginner-friendly species to consider:

- **Cherry Shrimp** – Hardy, colorful, and easy to breed. A great first choice.  
- **Amano Shrimp** – Excellent algae eaters and a little larger.  
- **Ghost Shrimp** – Inexpensive and easy to care for. Great for learning.

## What You’ll Need to Get Started

To set up your shrimp tank, you'll need:

- A **5 to 10-gallon tank**  
- A **gentle sponge filter** (won’t suck up baby shrimp)  
- **Aquarium-safe substrate** like Fluval Stratum or eco-complete  
- Live plants: Java Moss, Anubias, Hornwort  
- A heater (if your room temp drops below 68°F)  
- Test kits for ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and pH  
- Shrimp-safe food and minerals

## Setting Up Your Shrimp Tank

Here’s a quick step-by-step setup:

1. Rinse substrate and add it to your tank.
2. Fill with dechlorinated water.
3. Install sponge filter and heater.
4. Add live plants and decorations.
5. Let your tank **cycle** for 4–6 weeks (very important!).
6. Test water until ammonia and nitrites are at 0 and nitrates are under 40 ppm.
7. Acclimate your shrimp slowly—drip method is best.

## Feeding and Care Tips

Shrimp love variety. Feed them:

- Blanched spinach or zucchini  
- Shrimp-specific pellets or wafers  
- Occasional protein-rich treats

Avoid overfeeding! It’s one of the most common mistakes. Use a feeding dish and 
remove leftovers after a few hours.
