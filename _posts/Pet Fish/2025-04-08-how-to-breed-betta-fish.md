## Step-by-Step Breeding Process

### Step 1: **Conditioning the Pair**

Feed both the male and female Betta high-protein food such as frozen bloodworms 
or live brine shrimp for 7–14 days. Keep them in separate tanks or use a clear divider.

### Step 2: **Set Up the Breeding Tank**

- Use a shallow 5–10 gallon tank.
- Maintain water temperature at 78–82°F.
- Add Indian almond leaves to reduce stress and promote bubble nest building.
- Keep water level low (4–5 inches) to make it easier for the male to collect eggs.

### Step 3: **Introduce the Pair**

Place the female in a clear container inside the breeding tank for 1–2 days. 
The male will begin building a bubble nest.

If the female shows vertical stripes and the male is flaring without aggression, 
it's time to release her.

⚠️ **Warning**: Watch closely — if aggression is high, separate them immediately.

### Step 4: **Spawning**

Spawning can take several hours. The male wraps around the female and fertilizes 
the eggs. He then collects the eggs in his mouth and places them in the bubble nest.

After spawning:
- Remove the female.
- Let the male care for the eggs and fry.

### Step 5: **Fry Care**

- Eggs hatch in 24–48 hours.
- Fry become free-swimming in 3–4 days.
- At this point, **remove the male**.
- Feed infusoria, followed by baby brine shrimp or micro worms.

Keep water clean and do regular small water changes.

## Final Tips

- Never rush the breeding process.
- Ensure proper water conditions and diet before starting.
- Be prepared to care for dozens of tiny fry!
